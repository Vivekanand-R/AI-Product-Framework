**S&P 500: Best Practices: Ways to Improve Sales Margin:**

1. Define Prices Strategically: Product or Services, Supply and Demand. 
2. Cut Low-Value Costs: Supplier negotiation, identify waste, get rid of over-engineered features, unnecessary expenses, inefficient advertisements, automating repetitive tasks, enhance operational efficiency, Inventory Management to avoid over stocking.

Value-Based Pricing: Pricing based on perceived customer value.

Competitor-Based Pricing: Setting prices relative to competitors.

Customer Segmentation & Willingness to Pay: Tailoring prices to different customer groups.

**Specialized Pricing Frameworks:**

-----------------------------------------------------------

**Other Concepts:**

**Monopoly: Core Concept**

A monopoly is a market structure where a single seller dominates the entire market for a product or service with no close substitutes. Price maker, meaning it has substantial control over pricing, output, and market conditions—something that’s impossible in more competitive markets.

1. Natural Monopoly: Utilities (e.g., Electricity, Water) -  Local electric utilities, Regulated.
2. Legal Monopoly: Pharmaceuticals.
   
Example: Pharma company on xyz product (cholesterol drug) before its patent expired. Why It’s a Monopoly: Patent laws grant exclusive rights to sell a drug for a period (usually 20 years).

3. Platform Monopoly (Near-Monopoly): Google in Search.
   
   Example 1: Google controls over 90% of global search engine market share. Why It’s a Monopoly: Network effects (more users = better data = better product), high switching costs, and dominance in ads.
   Example 2: Used OS dominance to restrict competition in browser market
   
4. Resource Monopoly: De Beers and Diamonds. De Beers once controlled 85–90% of the global rough diamond supply.
